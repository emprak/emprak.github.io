						<p1>The modern backpacker is almost immune to the wiles of the Fae, purely by the nature of the hobby. 
							An experienced backpacker knows where they are, where they will sleep, and -- often -- whereabouts they plan to be at three in the afternoon tomorrow. 
							They generally have shelter, drink, and food of their own. amd many a Fae has been laughed at for a decade after trying to bind a backpacker by their trailname.</p1>
					<br><br>
						<p1>An office worker, though, wandering into a small wood after a day of work, thinking that having roads in all four directions means they can't get lost... that is more enticing to the Fae by far.</p1>
					<br><br>
						<p1>So you see, the Fae were never really bound to grassy clearings deep in the forest, secluded pools of clear water, nor even to so-called faerie rings. 
							It's more that, 500 years ago, those were the places where mortals were likely to be <i>wandering</i>, as opposed to travelling with purpose.</p1>
					<br><br>
						<p1>In these days, Fae may stalk and scheme rather closer to our houses then we like to think.</p1>
